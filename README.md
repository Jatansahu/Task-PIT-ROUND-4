# Task-PIT-ROUND-4
This repository contains an analysis and implementation of Point-in-Time (PIT) joins to prevent data leakage in machine learning models. It includes a detailed examination of the MULTIPLE_FEATURE_VIEW_POINT_IN_TIME_JOIN function from Feast, covering edge cases, usage, and a custom Python implementation of PIT joins without SQL.
